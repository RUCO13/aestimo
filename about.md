# What is Aestimo

Aestimo is a self-consistent Schr√∂dinger-Poisson solver written for simulating basic physical phenomena of 1-dimensional (1-D) semiconductor heterostructures. Aestimo was started as a hobby by Assoc. Prof. Sefer Bora Lisesivdin from Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey, at the beginning of 2012, and become an usable tool which can be used as a co-tool in an educational and scientific work.

# Who can use it?

Aestimo is aimed to be both educational and research tool. For educational purposes, it must be easy to understand. For research, it must have some point of computational correctness and sensitivity. Written in Python scripting language, broadly used by scientific community, combines easy access to external quality libraries and source code with speedy and accurate simulation, extensibility, and community technical support. The very basic experience with computer programming is needed (if at all) and very basic physics understanding to start manipulating existing examples or even to design new models.
